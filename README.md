# About me
- 📚 As a dedicated Computer Science student, my passions lie in the fields of programming and cybersecurity.
- 🚩 I have a particular interest in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions. In 2024 I participated at [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it), I learned many things from this experience.
- 👨‍💻 I also enjoy solving problems on **LeetCode**, which helps me refine my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This practice has reinforced my algorithmic thinking.
