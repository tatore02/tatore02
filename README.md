# About me
- :books: As a dedicated Computer Science student, my passions lie in the fields of programming and cybersecurity.
- :triangular_flag_on_post: I have a particular interest in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions. In 2024 I participated at [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it), I learned many things from this experience.
- 👨‍💻 I also enjoy solving problems on **LeetCode**, which helps me refine my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This practice has reinforced my algorithmic thinking.

- 🤓 In addition to my technical interests, I am an avid reader. I enjoy immersing myself in books, ranging from computer science to science fiction, which extend my perspective and inspire my creativity.
